The truth about the mysterious Hip Huck Apotomous!
<p>
The Hip-Huck-Apotomous story is a long and varied tale.
This dinosaur was one of the first to become extinct, which has had scholars 
perplexed for ages.  We are here to pass along the lost knowledge.
<p>  
The blood line draw from the early Paleolithic era with our most active of 
ancestors, the Hipposaourus.  His Latin name Hippolayoutamushorizosmaximus.  
This creature could be found in four glorious colors: green, yellow, purple and blue.
All the other creatures were jealous of the beautiful colors and how easily 
the hippos could form ultimate teams.  These original hippos where in really 
great shape since all they did was play ulti all day long.  A far cry from 
the libelous image put forth by our nemesis Milton and his buddy Bradley.
<p>
It was no meteor or ice age that did them in.  
It was their love of the layout that got them.  
It just wouldn't matter how close to a precipice or dangling participle 
these hippos would bid on a perfect horizontal.  
<p>
One by one the entire species flung themselves off a cliff! As Pangaea broke 
apart our distant cousins where growing closer to extinction.
<p>
Alas, there were only four that survived.  They happened to be a little more 
rotund.  One of each color, by a strange happenstance.  Since they could 
not move as fast as the others, they were stuck tossing it deep for the 
other hipposauruses.  Over the years they developed their hucking skills 
and become an elite force organizing the original ultimate body -- the Ultimate Hippos Association. 
<p>
This species resembles what we now know as Hippopotamus.  
They were the Hip-Huck-Apotomous! 
<p>
We have rounded up the whole heard and brought them back again to take the field against the best that you can throw at us and to tell our story.  The story that Milton &amp; Bradley left out.  Yes these hippos are hungry hungry!  But the didn't warn you that the the hungry, hungry hippos are hungry for the HUCK!
