<div class="title" align="center">History and Evolution</div>

Like a dream or a voice on the wind, it calls to us.<br>
Return to your island home to bring forth the spirt.

Our oldest roots stretch back to KK8 in the dark mud of Kapiolani Park.  Well worth skipping Senior Year midterms for a shot to play on the alumni team as a current student.  The Caltech Reunion team, <i>The Sarcastic Fringeheads</i> (or 
as our cotton shirts said that year, Ceci N'est Pas une Fringehead Sarcastique).
<p>

I didn't know if I'd ever get back having moved to NYC.  Then I got to talking to Scottie, and he said "oh yeah we're going back. Let's get a bid together RIGHT NOW." And thus the infamous lorax was born and took our licks at KK17.  I was overjoyed to see the Fringeheads win the spirit award.  I felt doubly blessed when they invited me to join in the celebratory beverage -- my kaimana spirit shot glass has a spot of honor on the hearth.
<p>
KK18 was a sad time.  We secured a bid but couldn't get momentum to get over the hump of 14 hour travel times from NY.
<p>
KK20 brought forth a new plan: Scott just went to watch.  Is that retirement I hear creeping up?  A decade between Kaimana visits is just too long!

The call of the West is strong.  The sirens of youth call forth.  The mighty Pacific weaves a beautiful charm.  And so we have moved back to the shores of the pacific, here in Calironia.  Scott and I find ourselves back, and available, and with new frisbee friends to draw from.  Foca with his organizational and mingling skills have put us together a rockstar line ready to represent.  From the ashes of the lorax, we arise phoenix like, the hip-huck-apotomous.  Our spirit is still strong and our love runs deep.  I can't wait to party with you all again.
<p>
Aloha and Mahalo,
